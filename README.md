# Exemplary flow-based market coupling optimization model based on a test network

## Background/context:
The model was created in connection with the working paper **"Toward understanding flow-based market coupling: An open-access model"** by *David Schönheit, Michiel Kenis, Lisa Lorenz, Dominik Möst, Erik Delarue and Kenneth Bruninx*

## Notes on data:
Test network is based on Barrios, H., Roehder, A., Natemeyer, H., & Schnettler, A. (2015, June). A benchmark case for network expansion methods. In 2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech (pp. 1-6). IEEE. Data set available under: https://www.iaew.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/ivfsh/?lidx=1

Test network was modified to fit the purpose of this model.
